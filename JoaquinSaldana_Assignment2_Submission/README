Assignment 2 

======================================

1. ftserver 

The following files are required to compile and run the ftserver

ftserver.c 
ftserver.h
main.c 
Makefile 

Once the file are in the same directory, type “make” into the command line.  Once the program compiles you can run the 
program by typing the following syntax: 

ftserver [port number]

This port number must be greater than 1024 and less than 65535.  This port number is used to create the connection 
socket for the server.   

A clean target was included in the makefile if you wish to remove the .o files and the executable file once you are finished testing the program.  

=======================================

2. ftclient.py

Before you run this program you will need to ensure it’s an executable file.  

In the terminal, type in the command “ls -pla” and verify ftclient.py is an executable file.  If not, i ask that 
you please run the following command: 

chmod +x ftclient.py

This will convert it to an executable file.  

After it’s been converted to an executable file (if necessary), if you wish to get LIST of the files in the 
server’s directory you will need to execute the ftclient w/ the following syntax: 

ftclient.py [server_host] [server_port_number] -l [data_connection_port_number]

If you wish to get a FILE from the server’s directory, then you will need to execute the ftclient w/ the following 
syntax: 

ftclient.py [server_host] [server_port_number] -g [file_name] [data_connection_port_number]


IMPORTANT NOTE: notice the different syntax depending on the request (did in order on what was written on the assignment
sheet) 

Also, [server_host] was either, example, flip2 or flip2.engr.oregonstate.edu

=======================================

Included in the .zip file are 5 plaintext files that i used to test my program.  Feel free to use these as well if you care to do so.  Thanks.
